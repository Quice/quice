<p>
	Quice is an Android and iOS application that tells you what you should eat by analyzing many data like your physical activity, your morphology and others...

<h2>
	Technologies used
</h2>

<p>
	Here is a list of the technologies we use:
</p>

<!-- - **Vue.js**

	Vue.js was chosen for its great potential. Thanks to its modularity we are convinced that Vue.js is a technology that will dominate in the future. The arrival of its third version seems to confirm it.

	Moreover, despite its power, the framework is very simple to use and understand, which is very positive for collaboration. -->

Because we want to be a young project, which uses the next-gen technologies, we will use these technologies:

- For the application, **Flutter** → https://github.com/flutter/flutter

	Flutter is the future of Mobile App Development. The feature that convinced us the most is the creation of cross-platform applications based on a single code base.
	
	You can know more about why we chose Flutter by reading [this article](https://dev.to/joebrain032/13-reasons-why-flutter-is-the-future-of-mobile-app-development-240n).

- For the machine learning and data science part, **Julia** → https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia

	Julia is a very recent language which is very promising. It is a very fast language, which has a lot of data science and machine learning integrations.

- For the backend, **Rust** → https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript

	Rust is a recent popular language. It is fast, powerful, and has a super community.

	Thanks to its garbage collector, unit, and integration testing, Rust has less bugs than C or C++.

- For the database, **CockroachDB** → https://github.com/python

	The future of database is the NewSQL databases. It combines the advantages of a NoSQL database, with those of a relationnal databse.

	CockroachDB is the most successful DBMS in this field. This is the reason why it was chosen.

<h2>
	Best Practices
</h2>

<p>
	Here a list of the internal Best Practices we use:
<p>

- [Best Practices for Flutter](https://medium.com/flutter-community/flutter-best-practices-and-tips-7c2782c9ebb5)
- [Best Practices for Julia](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/style-guide/)
- [Best Practices for Rust](https://github.com/mre/idiomatic-rust)
- [Best Practices for CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/performance-best-practices-overview.html)
- [Best Practices for commit messages (Emoji commit messages)](https://gitmoji.dev/)
- [Best Practices for REST API](https://restfulapi.net/resource-naming/)

<h2>
	Formatting
</h2>

To keep the project clean and readable, each file should be commited following the formatting of the [.prettierrc file](./.prettierrc). Of course, you are free to format the code as you want when you are editing it.

The [.prettierrc file](./.prettierrc) will be in all repository.
